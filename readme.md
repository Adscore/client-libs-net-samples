# What is this

This is a super simple sample showing how one could use Adscore API within his code.

## The purpose of clients-libs-net-samples

All examples shown in the code fails, because samples does not contain appropriate adscore signature and key.
These samples show usage of the Signature Verify API and should be used with correct data.

## Where I find sample code?

`src\ExampleApp\Controllers\SignatureController.cs` contains  logic, rest is ASP.NET Core boilerplate.
